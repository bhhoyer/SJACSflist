## San Juan County WA Auxilliary Communications Frequency List

### Purpose
San Juan County WA is a group of islands that operate multuple EMCOMM Stations as well as individual stations, fixed mobile and portable. It is important that the stations have a common list of frequencies on all bands that are consistent in naming convention thus we use a master list that contains that information. Further we support a variety of different radios and need a way to generate programming files for each supported radio make/model.

### Formats Used
* All files associated with the project shall be in plain text
* Documentation shall be in Mark Down
* Data files shall be in csv format
* Chirp, available from http://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home will be used for test and verification
* Manufacturer specific formats will be supported on an as needed basis
